## Summary:
"I‚Äôve been a full-stack developer since 2018, starting with Java (Spring) and Angular7 as my primary stack. At Accenture, I expanded my expertise to include Node.js and React, focusing on end-to-end development. My specialization lies in developing APIs for banking Microservices, implementing OpenAI integrations, and building ML data pipelines with the ELK stack. I‚Äôve also leveraged serverless platforms like Firebase and Amplify for rapid app development. Additionally, I provided consulting services on headless frameworks such as AEM, built on Java (OSGI).  
As a Frontend Specialist, I collaborated closely with architects to design and implement modern systems for banking clients, deepening my understanding of large-scale integrations. I also mentored teams on best practices, code quality, and scalable architecture. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on emerging technologies like React Server Components and cloud-native services, recognizing their potential to enhance both user and developer experiences."
