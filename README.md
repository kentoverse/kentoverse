🔥 BotWorks Project — Technical Overview

BotWorks is an engineering initiative exploring structured intent modeling, narrative inputs, and AI-orchestrated task generation. It is built as a modular ecosystem composed of interoperable clients, servers, and automation tools.

⸻

🟦 1. BotWorks Expo App (React Native cross-platform client)

A mobile interface designed to convert user intent into structured tasks using three computed dimensions:

Connection

Defines contextual anchors (people, projects, goals, emotional drivers).

Intensity

Quantifies urgency, cognitive load, and motivational energy.

Materialization

Determines output type:
task • note • plan • story-beat • subgoal • reflection

Core Features
	•	Neon-driven JSON design system
	•	Cross-platform IconCore SVG architecture
	•	Slide-based narrative UI
	•	Theme-aware components for mobile & web
	•	Future integration with MCP multi-agent AI backend

🟧 2. BotWorks MCP Server (AI Orchestration Layer)

A FastAPI server that processes narrative inputs and converts them into structured task objects.

Capabilities
	•	Multi-agent orchestration (manager/worker)
	•	RAG pipelines using ChromaDB or IBM RAG
	•	Vector similarity search
	•	Scoring for Connection, Intensity, Materialization
	•	API endpoints supporting Expo, Telegram bot, and static sites
	•	Containerized deployment (GCP / Azure)

⸻

🟩 3. Gmail → Telegram Automation Bot

A lightweight automation module enabling:
	•	Extracting email content using Gmail API
	•	NLP summarization and intent classification
	•	Routing actionable content to Telegram
	•	Triggering MCP workflows
	•	Deployment via Docker containers on GCP
