> I’ve been a web developer since 2008, starting with WordPress, PHP, and jQuery before transitioning into object-oriented programming with Java and C#. Over time, I’ve expanded into modern full-stack development using frameworks like MERN, Next.js, and cloud-native serverless architectures. I focus on building scalable, efficient applications with intuitive user experiences, continuously refining my skills to stay current with the latest tools and technologies that enhance performance and streamline development workflows.
